## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to do the border-radius styling on the container part and hide the overflow instead of doing it manually on each outer section part.

### Continued development

Every container's corner should be round even after the page is zoomed out.
